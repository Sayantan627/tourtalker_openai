## About The App

TourTalker was conceived to seamlessly blend chat communication with the joy of global exploration. The project aims to provide users with a unique platform where they can engage in lively conversations using OpenAI-powered chat functionalities. The motivation behind TourTalker is to not only facilitate meaningful interactions but also to enhance the travel experience. By allowing users to input a city and country, TourTalker generates personalized recommendations for famous tourist places, transforming ordinary conversations into global adventures. The project's goal is to make communication and discovery effortlessly intertwined, offering users a novel and enjoyable way to explore the world.

## Technologies

I used `html`, `css`, `Javascript`, `ReactJs`, `NextJs`, `TailwindCSS`, `React Query`

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Approach

- I used [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) for components and themes.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is used to design the application with awesome styles and responsiveness
- Used [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication.
- I used [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) which is an open-source ORM that makes it fun and safe to work with a database like MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, or MongoDB.
- Used OpenAI API for creating the AI chat system ðŸ¤– and for generating famous tourist attractions of a city
- React-icons for the icons in the app

## Status

TourTalker is still in progress. `Version 2` will be out soon.
